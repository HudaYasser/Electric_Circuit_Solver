# Electric_Circuit_Solver
Electric Circuit Solver is a Python-based project designed to simulate, analyze, and design electronic circuits virtually. This program enables users, such as electrical engineers, hobbyists, or students, to create, test, and refine various electronic circuit designs without physically building them. It typically includes a user-friendly interface with a set of tools and features tailored for circuit design and analysis.
